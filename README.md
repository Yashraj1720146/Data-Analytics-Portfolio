# Python Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains my work in data analysis, focusing on the core scientific computing and visualization libraries in Python.


## Core Technologies

The projects and scripts in this portfolio demonstrate proficiency with the following libraries:

**NumPy:** Utilized for fundamental numerical computations and array manipulations.
**Pandas:** Used for high-performance data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis, primarily through its DataFrame structures.
**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Employed for a wide range of data visualization tasks, from creating foundational plots to developing insightful and aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
